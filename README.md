# communication-log-ROLE
Purpose of this file was to do the following:
 1. Quickly add code in pull + push cycles (Important! This is the fundamental process!)
 2. Add a collaborator to a GitHub Project
 3. Share repositories on GitHub
 We still need to do the following:
 4. Create a branch in Git
 5. Create a pull request in GitHub
 6. Resolve merge conflicts (which are not as scary as they sound)
